# Graffiti

The Graffiti API makes it possible to build social
applications that are flexible and interoperable.
This API is the heart of the project because it forms
the human interface to the system. There are multiple different
implementations of the API - ones that run entirely locally
for tests and different decentralized implementations. However,
none of the complexity of these implementations is exposed to
the user. The user only sees the API.
