/**
 * This API describes a small but powerful set of methods that
 * can be used to create many different kinds of social applications,
 * from applications like Twitter, to Messenger, to Wikipedia, to many more new designs.
 * See the [Graffiti project website](https://graffiti.garden)
 * for links to example applications. Additionally, apps built on top
 * of the API interoperate with each other so you can seamlessly switch
 * between apps without losing your friends or data.
 *
 * These API methods should satisfy all of an application's needs for
 * the communication, storage, and access management of social data.
 * The rest of the application can be built with standard client-side
 * user interface tools to present and interact with that dataâ€”no server code necessary!
 *
 * The Typescript code for this API is [open source on Github](https://github.com/graffiti-garden/api).
 *
 * There are several different implementations of this Graffiti API available,
 * including a [federated implementation](https://github.com/graffiti-garden/implementation-remote),
 * that lets people choose where their data is stored (you do not need to host your own server)
 * and a [local implementation](https://github.com/graffiti-garden/implementation-local)
 * that can be used for testing and development. Different implementations can
 * be swapped-in in the future without changing the API or any of the apps built on
 * top of it. In fact, we're working on an end-to-end encrypted version now!
 * [Follow Theia on BlueSky for updates](https://bsky.app/profile/theias.place).
 *
 * On the other side of the stack, there is [Vue plugin](https://vue.graffiti.garden/variables/GraffitiPlugin.html)
 * that wraps around this API to provide reactivity. Other plugin frameworks
 * and high-level libraries will be available in the future.
 *
 * ## API Overview
 *
 * The Graffiti API provides applications with methods for {@link login} and {@link logout},
 * methods to store data objects using standard database operations ({@link put}, {@link get}, {@link patch}, and {@link delete}),
 * and a method to {@link discover} data objects from other people.
 * These data objects have a couple structured properties:
 * - {@link GraffitiObjectBase.url | `url`} (string): A globally unique identifier and locator for the object.
 * - {@link GraffitiObjectBase.actor | `actor`} (string): An unforgeable identifier for the creator of the object.
 * - {@link GraffitiObjectBase.allowed | `allowed`} (string[] | undefined): An array of the identities who are allowed to access the object (undefined for public objects).
 * - {@link GraffitiObjectBase.channels | `channels`} (string[]): An array of the *contexts* in which the object should appear.
 * - {@link GraffitiObjectBase.lastModified | `revision`} (number): A number to compare different versions of an object.
 *
 * All other data is stored in the object's unstructured {@link GraffitiObjectBase.value | `value`} property.
 * This data can be used to represent social artifacts (e.g. posts, profiles) and activities (e.g. likes, follows).
 * For example, a post might have the value:

 * ```js
 * {
 *   title: "My First Post",
 *   content: "Hello, world!",
 *   published: 1630483200000
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * a profile might have the value:
 *
 * ```js
 * {
 *   name: "Theia Henderson",
 *   pronouns: "she/her",
 *   describes: "did:web:theias.place" // Theia's actor ID
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * and a "Like" might have the value:
 *
 * ```js
 * {
 *   activity: "Like",
 *   target: "graffiti:remote:pod.graffiti.garden/12345" // The URL of the graffiti object being liked
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * New social artifacts and activities can be easily created, simply
 * by creating new objects with appropriate properties. Despite the lack of
 * structure, we expect Graffiti object properties to adhere to a "[folksonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy)",
 * similar to hashtags. Any string can be used as a hashtag on Twitter,
 * but there is social value in using the same hashtags at other people and
 * so a structure naturally emerges. Similarly, Graffiti objects
 * can have arbitrary properties but if people use the same properties as each other,
 * their apps will interoperate, which has social value.
 *
 * For a more complete and detailed overview of Graffiti's design, please
 * refer to [this section of the Graffiti paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3746059.3747627#sec-3),
 * published in ACM UIST 2025. The paper also overviews {@link GraffitiObjectBase.channels | `channels`},
 * which are Graffiti's means of organizing data contextually, and a concept called "total reification",
 * which handles explains how moderation, collaboration, and other interactions are managed.
