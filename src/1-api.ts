/**
 * This API describes a small but powerful set of methods that
 * can be used to create many different kinds of social media applications,
 * all of which can interoperate.
 * These methods should satisfy all of an application's needs for
 * the communication, storage, and access management of social data.
 * The rest of the application can be built with standard client-side
 * user interface tools to present and interact with the data â€”
 * no server code necessary.
 * The Typescript source for this API is available at
 * [graffiti-garden/api](https://github.com/graffiti-garden/api).
 *
 * There are several different implementations of this Graffiti API available,
 * including a [federated implementation](https://github.com/graffiti-garden/implementation-federated),
 * that lets users choose where their data is stored,
 * and a [local implementation](https://github.com/graffiti-garden/implementation-local)
 * that can be used for testing and development. In our design of Graffiti, this API is our
 * primary focus as it is the layer that shapes the experience
 * of developing applications. While different implementations can provide tradeoffs between
 * other important properties (e.g. privacy, security, scalability), those properties
 * are useless if the system as a whole doesn't expose useful functionality to developers.
 *
 * On the other side of the stack, there is [Vue plugin](https://github.com/graffiti-garden/wrapper-vue/)
 * that wraps around this API to provide reactivity. Other high-level libraries
 * will be available in the future.
 *
 * ## Overview
 *
 * Graffiti provides applications with methods to create and store data
 * on behalf of their users using standard CRUD operations:
 *  {@link put}, {@link get}, {@link patch}, and {@link delete}.
 * This data can represent both social artifacts (e.g. posts, profiles) and
 * activities (e.g. likes, follows) and is stored as JSON.
 *
 * The social aspect of Graffiti comes from the {@link discover} method
 * which allows applications to find objects that other users made.
 * It is a lot like a traditional query operation, but it only
 * returns objects that have been placed in particular
 * {@link GraffitiObjectBase.channels | `channels`}
 * specified by the discovering application.
 *
 * Graffiti builds on well known concepts and standards wherever possible.
 * JSON Objects can be typed with [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) and patches
 * can be applied with [JSON Patch](https://jsonpatch.com).
 * For interoperability between Graffiti applications, we recommend that
 * objects use established properties from the
 * [Activity Vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/) when available,
 * however it is always possible to create additional properties, contributing
 * to the broader [folksonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy).
 *
 * {@link GraffitiObjectBase.channels | `channels`} are one of the major concepts
 * unique to Graffiti along with *interaction relativity*, defined below.
 * Channels create boundaries between public spaces and work to prevent
 * [context collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_collapse)
 * even in a highly interoperable environment.
 * Interaction relativity means that all interactions between users are
 * actually atomic single-user operations that can be interpreted in different ways,
 * which also supports interoperability and pluralism.
 *
 * ### Channels
 *
 * {@link GraffitiObjectBase.channels | `channels`}
 * are a way for the creators of social data to express the intended audience of their
 * data. When a user creates data using the {@link put} method, they
 * can place their data in one or more channels.
 * Content consumers using the {@link discover} method will only see data
 * contained in one of the channels they specify.
 *
 * While many channels may be public, they partition
 * the public into different "contexts", mitigating the
 * phenomenon of [context collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_collapse) or the "flattening of multiple audiences."
 * Any [URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier) can be used as a channel, and so channels can represent people,
 * comment threads, topics, places (real or virtual), pieces of media, and more.
 *
 * For example, consider a comment on a post. If we place that comment in the channel
 * represented by the post's URL, then only people viewing the post will know to
 * look in that channel, giving it visibility akin to a comment on a blog post
 * or comment on Instagram ([since 2019](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katienotopoulos/instagrams-following-activity-tab-is-going-away)).
 * If we also place the comment in the channel represented by the commenter's URI (their
 * {@link GraffitiObjectBase.actor | `actor` URI}), then people viewing the commenter's profile
 * will also see the comment, giving it more visibility, like a reply on Twitter.
 * If we *only* place the comment in the channel represented by the commenter's URI, then
 * it becomes like a quote tweet ([prior to 2020](https://x.com/Support/status/1300555325750292480)),
 * where the comment is only visible to the commenter's followers but not the audience
 * of the original post.
 *
 * The channel model differs from other models of communication such as the
 * [actor model](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#Overview) used by ActivityPub,
 * the protocol underlying Mastodon, or the [firehose model](https://bsky.social/about/blog/5-5-2023-federation-architecture)
 * used by the AT Protocol, the protocol underlying BlueSky.
 * The actor model is a fusion of direct messaging (like Email) and broadcasting
 * (like RSS) and works well for follow-based communication but struggles
 * to pass information via other rendez-vous.
 * In the actor model, even something as simple as comments can be
 * [very tricky and require server "side effects"](https://seb.jambor.dev/posts/understanding-activitypub-part-3-the-state-of-mastodon/).
 * The firehose model dumps all user data into one public database,
 * which doesn't allow for the carving out of different contexts that we did in our comment
 * example above. In the firehose model a comment will always be visible to *both* the original post's audience and
 * the commenter's followers.
 *
 * In some sense, channels provide a sort of "social access control" by forming
 * expectations about the audiences of different online spaces.
 * As a real world analogy, oftentimes support groups, such as alcoholics
 * anonymous, are open to the public but people in those spaces feel comfortable sharing intimate details
 * because they have expectations about the other people attending.
 * If someone malicious went to support groups just to spread people's secrets,
 * they would be shamed for violating these norms.
 * Similarly, in Graffiti, while you could spider public channels like a search engine
 * to find content about a person, revealing that you've done such a thing
 * would be shameful.
 *
 * Still, social access control is not perfect and so in situations where privacy is important,
 * objects can also be given
 * an {@link GraffitiObjectBase.allowed | `allowed`} list.
 * For example, to send someone a direct message you should put an object representing
 * that message in the channel that represents them (their {@link GraffitiObjectBase.actor | `actor` URI}),
 * so they can find it, *and* set the `allowed` field to only include the recipient,
 * so only they can read it.
 *
 * ### Interaction relativity
 *
 * Interaction relativity posits that "interaction between two individuals only
 * exists relative to an observer," or equivalently, all interaction is [reified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reification_(computer_science)).
 * For example, if one user creates a post and another user wants to "like" that post,
 * their like is not modifying the original post, it is simply another data object that points
 * to the post being liked, via its {@link GraffitiObjectBase.url | URL}.
 *
 * ```json
 * {
 *   activity: 'like',
 *   target: 'url-of-the-post-i-like',
 *   actor: 'my-user-id'
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * In Graffiti, all interactions including *moderation* and *collaboration* are relative.
 * This means that applications can freely choose which interactions
 * they want to express to their users and how.
 * For example, one application could have a single fixed moderator,
 * another could allow users to choose which moderators they would like filter their content
 * like [Bluesky's stackable moderation](https://bsky.social/about/blog/03-12-2024-stackable-moderation),
 * and another could implement a fully democratic system like [PolicyKit](https://policykit.org/).
 * Each of these applications is one interpretation of the underlying refieid user interactions and
 * users can freely switch between them.
 *
 * Interaction relativy also allows applications to introduce new sorts of interactions
 * without having to coordinate with all the other existing applications,
 * keeping the ecosystem flexible and interoperable.
 * For example, an application could [add a "Trust" button to posts](https://social.cs.washington.edu/pub_details.html?id=trustnet)
 * and use it assess the truthfulness of posts made on applications across Graffiti.
 * New sorts of interactions like these can be smoothly absorbed by the broader ecosystem
 * as a [folksonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy).
 *
 * Interactivy relativity is realized in Graffiti through two design decisions:
 * 1. The creators of objects can only modify their own objects. It is important for
 *    users to be able to change and delete their own content to respect their
 *    [right to be forgotten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten),
 *    but beyond self-correction and self-censorship all other interaction is reified.
 *    Many interactions can be reified via pointers, as in the "like" example above, and collaborative
 *    edits can be refieid via [CRDTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type).
 * 2. No one owns channels. Unlike IRC/Slack channels or [Matrix rooms](https://matrix.org/docs/matrix-concepts/rooms_and_events/),
 *    anyone can post to any channel, so long as they know the URI of that channel.
 *    It is up to applications to hide content from channels either according to manual
 *    filters or in response to user action.
 *    For example, a user may create a post with the flag `disableReplies`.
 *    Applications could then filter out any content from the replies channel
 *    that the original poster has not specifically approved.
